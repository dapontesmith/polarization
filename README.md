# Polarization
Code and scripts for producing measures and analyses of affective polarization in Western democracies. Data is from the CSES integrated module, and is too large to post on Github. 
Script begins with clean CSES dataset. It then uses feeling thermometers towards parties to produce measures of outparty-dislike (and in-party "like").
